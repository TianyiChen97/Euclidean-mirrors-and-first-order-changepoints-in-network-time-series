This repository contains code supporting the text "Euclidean mirrors and first-order changepoints in network time series" by Tianyi Chen, Zachary Lubberts, Avanti Athreya, Youngser Park, Carey E. Priebe. 
## Abstract: 
We describe a model for a class of network time series whose evolution is governed by an underlying stochastic process, known as the latent position process, in which network evolution can be represented in Euclidean space by a curve, called the Euclidean mirror. We define the notion of a first-order changepoint for a time series of networks, and construct a family of latent position process networks with underlying first-order changepoints. We prove that a spectral estimate of the associated Euclidean mirror localizes these changepoints, even when the graph distribution evolves continuously, but at a rate that changes. Simulated and real data examples on organoid networks show that this localization identifies empirically significant shifts in network evolution.  
## Data

Data including the simulation results and the real data. We make our data avaliable and contians all of them in Figure_data.RData. Among it, the real
